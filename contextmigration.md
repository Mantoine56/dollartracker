# Context Migration Decision Document

## Overview
This document outlines the decision-making process and implementation details regarding the consolidation of context providers in the DollarTracker application.

## Background
The application had two separate context implementations:
1. Root context (`/context/`): The primary, actively used implementation
2. App context (`/app/context/`): An unused, potentially experimental implementation

## Analysis Findings

### Usage Patterns
- All active components use the root `/context` implementations
- No components import from `/app/context`
- The root contexts have proper provider hierarchy in `_layout.tsx`:
  ```
  QueryClientProvider
  └── SupabaseProvider
      └── AuthProvider
          └── UserProvider
              └── SettingsProvider
  ```

### Implementation Comparison
1. **Root Context**
   - Complete error handling
   - Proper TypeScript types
   - Integration with services
   - Consistent state management
   - Active usage throughout the application
   - Clear provider hierarchy

2. **App Context**
   - Incomplete implementation
   - No active usage
   - Duplicate functionality
   - No additional benefits for Expo Router

### Dependencies
- Settings depends on User context
- User depends on Auth context
- Auth depends on Supabase context
- All contexts properly integrated with Supabase client

## Decision
Based on thorough analysis, we decided to remove the `/app/context` directory and maintain the root context implementation as the single source of truth for application state management.

### Rationale
1. **Code Organization**: Single location for global state management
2. **Maintenance**: Reduces confusion and potential bugs from duplicate implementations
3. **Performance**: Eliminates unused code
4. **Best Practices**: Follows React and Expo Router conventions for global state management

## Implementation Steps
1. Verify no imports from `/app/context`
2. Back up `/app/context` directory
3. Remove `/app/context` directory
4. Update documentation
5. Test all affected components

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing context persistence for offline support
- Add performance monitoring for context updates
- Implement proper error boundaries for context providers
- Consider adding type-safe context creation utilities
